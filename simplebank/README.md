# About

This repository serves as a comprehensive documentation of my learning journey into gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) using the Go programming language . It is designed to explore and demonstrate the core concepts, best practices, and implementation details of building scalable and efficient microservices with gRPC.

Through this project, I aim to:

- Understand the fundamentals of Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) and how they define service contracts.
- Implement various gRPC communication patterns such as Unary RPC , Server Streaming , Client Streaming , and Bidirectional Streaming .
- Explore advanced topics like gRPC reflection , interceptors , authentication , and error handling .
- Build practical examples that simulate real-world use cases, helping solidify my understanding of gRPC in production-grade applications.
- This repository is not only a personal reference but also a resource for anyone interested in learning gRPC with Go. Contributions, suggestions, or feedback are always welcome—feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you have ideas for improvement!

I've create simple project from this learning journey. You can check it out in simplebank directory and below the guide setup 👇.
## Simple bank service
The service that we’re going to build is a simple bank. It will provide APIs for the frontend to do following things:

1. Create and manage bank accounts, which are composed of owner’s name, balance, and currency.
2. Record all balance changes to each of the account. So every time some money is added to or subtracted from the account, an account entry record will be created.
3. Perform a money transfer between 2 accounts. This should happen within a transaction, so that either both accounts’ balance are updated successfully or none of them are.

## Setup local development

### Install tools

- [Golang](https://golang.org/)
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- [Migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/tree/master/cmd/migrate)

  ```bash
  brew install golang-migrate
  ```

- [DB Docs](https://dbdocs.io/docs)

  ```bash
  npm install -g dbdocs
  dbdocs login
  ```

- [DBML CLI](https://www.dbml.org/cli/#installation)

  ```bash
  npm install -g @dbml/cli
  dbml2sql --version
  ```

- [Sqlc](https://github.com/kyleconroy/sqlc#installation)

  ```bash
  brew install sqlc
  ```

- [Gomock](https://github.com/golang/mock)

  ```bash
  go install github.com/golang/mock/mockgen@v1.6.0
  ```

### Setup infrastructure

- Create the bank-network

  ```bash
  make network
  ```

- Start postgres container:

  ```bash
  make postgres
  ```

- Create simple_bank database:

  ```bash
  make createdb
  ```

- Run db migration up all versions:

  ```bash
  make migrateup
  ```

- Run db migration up 1 version:

  ```bash
  make migrateup1
  ```

- Run db migration down all versions:

  ```bash
  make migratedown
  ```

- Run db migration down 1 version:

  ```bash
  make migratedown1
  ```

### Documentation

- Generate DB documentation:

  ```bash
  make db_docs
  ```

- Access the DB documentation at [this address](https://dbdocs.io/nandessimanjuntak1803/simple_bank). Password: `password`

### How to generate code

- Generate schema SQL file with DBML:

  ```bash
  make db_schema
  ```

- Generate SQL CRUD with sqlc:

  ```bash
  make sqlc
  ```

- Generate DB mock with gomock:

  ```bash
  make mock
  ```

- Create a new db migration:

  ```bash
  make new_migration name=<migration_name>
  ```

### How to run

- Run server:

  ```bash
  make server
  ```

- Run test:

  ```bash
  make test
  ```
